# Contributing to Echofy

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Echofy as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Coding Style

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- 80 character line length
- Run `npm run lint` to conform to our lint rules

## Feature Development Guidelines

Components in the AI section should be built with a focus on:
- Clear user feedback for AI processing
- Fallbacks for when AI services are unavailable
- Privacy-first approach to data handling

### Blockchain Components
When developing blockchain functionality:
- Always use testnet for development
- Include clear error handling for network issues
- Document gas costs for operations
- Provide simulation capabilities

### Community Features
Community features should:
- Support internationalization
